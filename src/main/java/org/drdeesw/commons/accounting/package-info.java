/**
 * This package contains interfaces and abstract classes for accounting.
 * They are not meant to be used directly, but rather serve as a foundation
 * for persons, organizations and service providers,
 * focusing on their commonality of accounts, account holders and account providers.
 * The concrete classes exist solely for the concept of holding accounts, since 
 * the held accounts can be provided by organization or service providers.
